### Hi there 👋,

I'm Brandon Harden, a full-stack software engineer with a passion for both front-end and back-end. Whether it's a database schema or dynamically rendering React components, I’m most engaged when I’m solving problems and learning new technologies. I love that full stack software engineering gives me the opportunity to work on everything that makes an application run efficiently. I am versed in assembling React, Express, Node.js, and MongoDB applications but always accept the challege of learning a new technology.
